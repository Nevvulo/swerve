# Swerve
Plugin for Powercord that allows you to censor specific words anywhere in Discord

## ⚠ This plugin is no longer being maintained and may not work
**Some things may not work as intended, or not work at all**. If you find an issue, unfortunately I can't do much as I have stopped maintaining this project.

## What is this?
Not a fan of swear words? Maybe there's just a specific word that you never, *ever* want to see again on Discord. Kiss those concerns bye-bye with **Swerve**.
Swerve will quite literally blur any words you have specified in the settings (by default, it's just a number of everyday swear words)

It even works on channel names, usernames and other areas of the Discord app!
